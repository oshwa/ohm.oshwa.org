### Step 2 - During the event - Discuss/Educate/Create

* Engage your local community about Open Source Hardware
* Based on the type of the event, either have an active discussion, share knowledge, or create something around the theme.
* Educate attendees about the Open Hardware Summit.
* Post pictures and videos on social media with the `#OpenOct` hashtag.


### Step 3 - After the event - Share

* Share your event recap with the Open Source Hardware Association by emailing info@oshwa.org
* Compilation of events will be shared at the Open Hardware Summit 2025


## How to host an online event or workshop

1. Create an organizing committee from within the OSHW community (whether local or global)
1. Discuss and decide on the event type, duration, platform, and date
1. Update Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) – Fill out the form and get approval
1. Plan logistics –
    * Event registration system (such as Eventbrite or Facebook event, etc.)
    * Streaming platform
    * Collaboration/community interaction tools
1. Find supporters based on your event requirements (Note: This will not be an Open Source Hardware Association sponsored event)
1. Send out the invitations
1. Promote your event (on social media)
1. Send out a thank you and follow-up (if any) note to the attendees


## How to Host a cocktail hour or meetup (1-2 hour event)

Hosting a cocktail hour is the easiest and least expensive way to bring your local open source hardware community together.

1. Post on Eventbrite, or some other RSVP platform, the time, date, and location
1. On the event page, encourage people to bring what Open Source Hardware they are working on so people have something to discuss (Size of project within reason)
1. Make sure your attendees and the venue know that **you are not picking up the tab**.  Give the bar/pub/cafe/restaurant a heads up on your headcount or make reservations if you have a lot of people coming
1. Do not make your event on the busiest night – a Mon / Tues / Wed is probably best – especially if you are a large group
1. Get people’s contact info so you can relay last-minute changes
1. Thank people for coming, sit back, and have a good time!
