Hardware Happy Hour is an informal way to socialize, show off your projects, and talk about the world of hardware.

We welcome anyone interested in any kind of hardware from beginner to expert: Arduino DIYers, engineers, hardware start up founders, e-textile experimenters, LED-curious folks, 3D printing enthusiasts or robotics geeks.

If youâ€™re working on something even vaguely related please do bring it along. No presentations, no pitch decks, just projects and conversation.
